    </header>

<h3>There is a draw that can be made when creating a tv logo. Which is the point to draw in the veiwer.</h3>

<p>The first step in the creation of a tv logo is finding the content that you are covering. For here we are going to look at the <em><i>Travel Channel</i></em> logo. </p>

<h6>Shows different styles of the <em><i>travel channel</i></em> logo</h6>
<p>Here is the link to see the orginal <em><i>Travel Channel</i></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.travelchannel.com/">Travel Channel</a></p>
<p>Once the idea is there now it comes down to gathering the pictures and video that you are going to use to put togther the TV logo.</p>

<!--Add in images from google photos personal account -->
<h5>Here are some examples:</h5>
<ul>
    <li><img src="img1.jpg"width="940"height="540"></li>
    <li><img src="img2.jpg"width="940"height="540"></li>
</ul>

<p>Somthing to remeber well puting a video togther is the solgan that the company holds to their brand for example:<blockqoute>"Travel moves you"</blockqoute></p>
<p>Showing a varity of diiferent locations a different types of video or potos can help create that effect specially when using video becasue of the movement that it has.</p>
<h5>Example of movement with in video:</h5>

<!--Added in personal videos-->
<video controls>
    <source src="video.MOV.mp4" Width="940" height="540">
</video>


<p>Some you have gathered all the images and video for putting the tv logo togther, next step is to put them all togther in an order you like.</p>

<p>Pattens that are good to go with when there is a lot of still images is to break it up with some video that transition well to each other.</p>

    <dt>Photos from moutina side</dt>

<p>Now after the video and graphics part is put togther then we need to add in some of the audio to help finsih off all the hard work putting the video together.</p>
