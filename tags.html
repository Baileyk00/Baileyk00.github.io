  <div class="P1"> This summer I had the chance to go up to McCall,ID to going fishing and camping.Though teh camping was staying a cabin this time. But to the picture this was out fly fishing at boulder reserve. It was coimg to the end of the day when I looked over to the mountians finding this beatuiful colors and the water being super calm. This image was taken on my Iphone 12 with the standard settings. But I made it focus center to help crispen up the image. It may look to have been just a flat strignht shot but its was angled just a little to help get and better image off of the water. One of hte coolest things when working with water when taking a picture or video si getting an image or nice light reflection off of the water. </div>

  <div class="P2">This last winter I got a new camera and what to go get some cool snow pictues. So what better place then Bogus Basin. We got up there just about when the sun was starting to set so the sky was filled of different colors. The time of day you go can effect the picture quality tht ayou get becasu e of the light it gives you r envoirnment. Here the sun is low so you loose a little bit of light but that can be more in your favor due to it not blowing the camera out. </div>
